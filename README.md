![Build Status](https://github.com/jabley/httptraced/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg)

Tool to monitor connection latency.

We want a tool that will happily run for long periods, as well as single-shot.

Hence this, rather than curl and cron (which only gives us minute-by-minute granularity).

It needs the new `net/http/httptrace` facility in Go 1.7.

## Usage

Install the command line via:
```shell
$ go get -u github.com/jabley/httptraced
```

Then use it to test 4 times, with a delay of 4 seconds, connection statistics to https://github.com/:
```shell
$ httptraced -c 4 -i 4 https://github.com/
